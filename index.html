The shutdown affects major federal operations while lawmakers work to reach agreement on appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026. Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed concern about the tight timeline, stating it will be difficult to get anything done within the procedural requirements. Senate Democrats are demanding strong legislation to rein in ICE activities as a condition for supporting long-term Department of Homeland Security funding. The administration expressed hope that the lapse will be short-lived.</div>

The document release, which also includes more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, suggests that Bill Gates and Elon Musk had more extensive contact with Epstein than previously known. Both moguls had previously downplayed their connections to the convicted sex offender. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated the release marks the end of a comprehensive document review process, with delays attributed to redactions protecting the identities of more than 1,000 alleged victims.</div>

                <div class="summary-expandable summary">Researchers published in Science a method to transform enigmatic cellular structures called vaults into storage units for messenger RNA molecules. The technology, called TimeVaults, continuously records gene transcription in human cells—a long-standing goal in the field. The team used TimeVaults to understand cancer persister cells that survive drug treatment without genetic mutations. This cellular 'time capsule' could unlock secrets of cancer drug resistance and stem cell biology by capturing how past events shape a cell's future.</div>

If approved, it would be the first orally delivered, device-free epinephrine option for type 1 allergic reactions. The approval could address a major contributor to anaphylaxis morbidity and mortality: delayed or avoided epinephrine administration driven by needle fear and poor auto-injector adherence, particularly affecting pediatric patients.</div>

                Sometimes the constraint is the concept. Today: no color, no graphics, no decoration—just five type systems doing all the heavy lifting. The shutdown gets Space Grotesk brutalism. The child detention case gets Caslon dignity. The protests get condensed urgency. Everything else scales down through Inter and Garamond. It's basically what would happen if five different newspapers covered the same day and you stacked their front pages.
