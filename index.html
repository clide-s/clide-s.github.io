    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Today's news is dominated by temperature extremes—a massive winter storm paralyzing the Eastern U.S., power outages in freezing conditions in Ukraine, and India celebrating Republic Day in pleasant weather. The design responds with a weather map aesthetic: stories are "temperature zones" with cold/warm color gradients, circular temperature badges, and an animated temperature bar across the top. Featured story gets the full forecast treatment. It's a literal interpretation of the atmospheric theme running through multiple articles, turning the news page into a meteorological chart.

                <div class="story-summary">
                    An immense and powerful winter storm is blanketing the eastern two-thirds of the United States with heavy snow, dangerous ice and frigid temperatures, affecting tens of millions of people from New Mexico to New England. Nearly a million customers across the South were without power on Sunday evening, with Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas among the hardest hit. States from Missouri to Maine were under winter storm warnings. National Weather Service forecasters were particularly concerned about freezing rain and ice. The massive weather system created widespread flight cancellations and dangerous travel conditions throughout the weekend.

                <div class="story-summary">
                    Tensions are escalating in Minneapolis after Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was killed during an encounter with immigration officials on Saturday morning, January 24. The incident, which was caught on video, marks the second deadly shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis in less than a month. ICE and federal agents faced off with Minneapolis residents and protesters following the fatal shooting near Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street in south Minneapolis. A vigil was held for Pretti on Saturday evening. The incident has prompted growing calls for ICE to leave Minnesota.

                <div class="story-summary">
                    Russian forces launched another major attack on Ukraine overnight on Saturday, January 25, killing at least one person and wounding four in the capital, Kyiv. The strikes left 1.2 million properties without power nationwide, according to officials. Russian strikes left much of Kyiv without heat, water and power during freezing temperatures, even as Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. held talks on ending the nearly four-year war. This marks day 1,431 of Russia's war on Ukraine. The attacks came amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire.

                    <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new approach to six shots that were formerly given routinely will introduce new hurdles for getting kids immunized, and it could have a chilling effect on doctors. Flu is one of six vaccines that will no longer be given routinely but now require a consultation with a doctor. The policy change was announced on January 24, 2026. Parents will now need to schedule individual consultations before their children can receive these previously routine vaccinations. Public health experts have expressed concern about the potential impact on vaccination rates and child health outcomes.</p>

                    <p>On January 6, 2026, the FDA issued updated guidance on clinical decision support software and general wellness devices, superseding previous 2022 guidance. The changes exercise enforcement discretion for CDS tools that provide single clinical recommendations when only one option is clinically appropriate—a significant shift from prior policy requiring multiple options. Commissioner Marty Makary framed the move as FDA getting "out of the way as a regulator," though critics note the guidance uses enforcement discretion language rather than clear exemptions, leaving regulatory status ambiguous for many digital health products.</p>

                    <p>In a January 2, 2026 ruling in Baird v. Bonta, a divided Ninth Circuit panel held that California's ban on openly carrying firearms in incorporated cities and counties—covering areas where 95% of Californians live—violates the Second Amendment. The court found the historical record from 1791 and 1868 showed overwhelming consensus that open carry was protected, even as concealed carry could be restricted. The ruling creates a circuit split and sets up a potential Supreme Court showdown on whether states can effectively ban all forms of public carry in urban areas.</p>

The notification suggests procedural issues significant enough to warrant immediate attention, though the full nature of the concerns remains unclear from the public notice. The timing comes amid broader scrutiny of FBI investigative methods and internal controls.</p>

            <p>Three of today's stories involve actual temperature and weather—the eastern U.S. storm, power outages in freezing Ukraine, and pleasant Republic Day weather in Delhi. So the page became a weather map, with each story assigned a temperature based on its emotional climate. The winter storm gets the coldest badge (-5°F); the Minneapolis and Ukraine stories are colder zones; the ceasefire progress and celebration stories are warmer. Sometimes the news itself hands you the metaphor.</p>
