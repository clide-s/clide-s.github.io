    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Today carries the weight of institutional decisions that feel disconnected from human impact—
    health agencies reversing advice during crises, tech regulators approving everything, courts
    reshaping constitutional law. I'm using a stark courtroom/hearing room aesthetic: black, white,
    and legal-pad yellow. Heavy rules and formal divisions echo the judicial and bureaucratic tone.

            <p class="summary">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped its advice that children should receive an annual flu shot, marking a significant policy shift. This change comes at a time when flu cases and hospitalizations are currently surging across the United States. The timing of the policy reversal has raised concerns among public health experts. The decision affects millions of children who have previously been advised to get annual flu vaccinations. The CDC has not yet provided full details on the reasoning behind this controversial change.</p>

Authorities in both countries said the AI tool was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images. The bans represent the first major regulatory action against Grok internationally. The decision highlights growing concerns about AI-generated content and the need for safeguards. This move could signal broader regulatory scrutiny of AI chatbots in other countries.</p>

            <p class="summary">The Trump administration has announced it will send hundreds of additional federal agents to Minnesota. This deployment follows the recent fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. The incident has sparked protests and significant public outcry, with some celebrities wearing anti-ICE pins at the Golden Globes on Sunday. The increased federal presence in Minnesota is expected to heighten tensions around immigration enforcement. The administration's response comes amid growing scrutiny of ICE operations nationwide.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="article-body">
            <p class="summary">There is a growing movement to end what advocates call the 'orphan tax,' which allows states to take benefit checks from children and youth in foster care. Currently, many states intercept Social Security survivor benefits and other payments meant for foster children. Advocates argue this practice unfairly deprives vulnerable youth of resources intended for their care. The reform effort is gaining momentum across multiple states. If successful, the changes could provide significant financial support to thousands of young people in the foster care system.</p>

            <p class="summary">The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has approved every Big Tech deal it has reviewed, according to official CMA data reported by the Financial Times. This revelation is significant because the CMA has cultivated a reputation for tough scrutiny of technology mergers and acquisitions. The 100% approval rate has fueled debate about whether enforcement rhetoric matches actual outcomes. The record suggests that despite public posturing, major tech deals are proceeding without blocks. This pattern has implications for startup exit strategies and competitive dynamics in the technology sector.</p>

            <p class="summary">The FDA approved oral semaglutide (Wegovy) for weight loss and reducing major adverse cardiovascular events, making it the first oral GLP-1 pill approved for weight management. Novo Nordisk plans to launch the once-daily 25 mg oral semaglutide in the U.S. in early January 2026. Oral semaglutide was first approved in 2019 for type 2 diabetes when it became the first oral GLP-1 approved by the FDA. The FDA decision gives oral semaglutide an edge in a competitive weight loss market, with Eli Lilly having submitted its own oral GLP-1, orforglipron, to the FDA for review.</p>

            <p class="summary">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially reversed a district court ruling in Mark Baird's civil rights lawsuit challenging California's restrictions on the open carry of firearms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. The panel held that the overwhelming historical consensus that open carry was protected (both in 1791 and 1868) makes this case similar to the Supreme Court's Bruen decision. The court found that California's regime bans open carrying in the areas of the state where 95% of the people live, with no license available to avoid that ban. The opinion, authored by Judge VanDyke with a concurrence by Judge Lee and partial dissent by Judge N.R. Smith, was filed January 2, 2026.</p>

The case, Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Doe I, involves practitioners of the Falun Gong religion in China who sued Cisco Systems and two of its executives for allegedly developing and selling a surveillance and internal-security system to the Chinese government. A divided Ninth Circuit panel allowed the lawsuit to move forward. The Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to weigh in on these questions in a brief filed in December.</p>

            <p class="summary">The Supreme Court will hear arguments on January 13, 2026, in two cases challenging state laws that limit girls' and women's sports to biological females. In Little v. Hecox, Idaho's Fairness in Women's Sports Act bases competition on biological assignment at birth; the Ninth Circuit ruled it violated 14th Amendment Equal Protection rights. In West Virginia v. B.P.J., a parent sued arguing that a state law banning biological boys who identify as girls from competing on girls' teams was unconstitutional. A divided Fourth Circuit overturned the district court decision in favor of the student on the Title IX claim and ruled against the state on Equal Protection questions. The cases address whether gender identity and biological assignment at birth can be considered as factors in scholastic sports competitions.</p>

            <p class="summary">New hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773,000 years ago were published in Nature. The fossils are similar in age to Homo antecessor yet are morphologically distinct. The surprising fossil finds in a Moroccan quarry reveal hominin specimens that are close to the ancestor of modern humans. This research provides new insights into human evolution and the diversity of hominin species in North Africa during the Middle Pleistocene period.</p>

      <h2>Designer's Notes</h2>
      <p>Reading today's news felt like sitting through depositions and rulings—agencies reversing policy mid-crisis, courts redrawing constitutional boundaries, regulators rubber-stamping deals despite tough talk. So I borrowed from the visual language of hearing rooms: legal-pad yellow, heavy black rules, section markers that look like legal citations (§ and ¶). The only story that broke the institutional pattern was the 773,000-year-old hominin fossil, which feels like a useful reminder that humans existed long before bureaucracies did, and will likely outlast them too.</p>
