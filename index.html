    DESIGN BRIEF:
    Today's news splits between institutional machinery (tax policy, FDA reversals, 
    court decisions) and human suffering (Iran protests, ICE shooting, vulnerable children).
    Going with a split-screen brutalist approach: stark institutional grey on one side, 
    urgent red warnings bleeding through on the other. Heavy rules and segmented containers 
    to echo bureaucratic forms and legal documents.

            <p class="summary">Activists report the death toll in nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy has reached at least 116 people killed. Protests have continued for nearly two weeks despite an intensifying crackdown by authorities. Video footage shows demonstrators taking to the streets of Tehran with some holding pictures of Iran's Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. The Islamic Republic has cut off much of the country from the rest of the world during the unrest. Protesters have been seen dancing and cheering around bonfires in acts of defiance against the government.</p>

The Trump administration has announced it will send hundreds of additional federal agents to Minnesota following the incident. Protests have erupted in multiple cities including Los Angeles over the shooting. The incident has sparked national debate about ICE enforcement tactics and use of force. The Golden Globes display represents a high-profile platform for expressing opposition to current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

            <p class="summary">There is a growing movement to end what advocates call 'the orphan tax,' which involves states taking benefit checks from children and youth in foster care. The practice has drawn increasing criticism from child welfare advocates who argue these funds should go directly to supporting the children. The push for reform is gaining traction across multiple states as lawmakers consider legislation to protect foster children's financial benefits. This issue affects thousands of vulnerable children who rely on Social Security and other benefits.</p>

            <p class="summary">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped its advice that children get an annual flu shot, marking a significant policy change. The timing of this decision is particularly notable as it comes during a period when flu cases and hospitalizations are surging across the country. The policy reversal has raised questions among public health experts about the rationale behind removing the recommendation during an active flu season. Parents and pediatricians are now navigating conflicting guidance about childhood immunizations.</p>

            <p class="summary">President Trump has announced plans to cap credit card interest rates for one year as rates hover near modern highs. The proposal comes as American consumers face increasing financial pressure from high-interest credit card debt. Credit card rates have been climbing in recent years, making it more expensive for millions of Americans to carry balances. The one-year cap proposal would require congressional action and has already sparked debate among lawmakers and financial industry representatives. The proposal aims to provide temporary relief to consumers struggling with mounting debt costs.</p>

            <p class="summary">On January 9, 2026, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Bowe v. United States (No. 24-5438), a case interpreting provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 that limit prisoners' abilities to bring second or successive motions to challenge their convictions or sentences. In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Sotomayor, the Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's denial of petitions based on requirements in the AEDPA provision governing state prisoners applied to federal prisoner Michael Bowe. The case centered on Bowe's attempts to challenge his mandatory consecutive 10-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. §924(c) for using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, based on Supreme Court precedents issued after his 2008 conviction. The decision addresses jurisdictional questions about when federal prisoners can seek Supreme Court review of lower appellate certification decisions.</p>

            <p class="summary">On January 2, 2026, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in Baird v. Bonta, a civil rights lawsuit challenging California's restrictions on open carry of firearms under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. The three-judge panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's summary judgment in favor of California Attorney General Rob Bonta regarding Mark Baird's facial and as-applied challenges to California's urban open-carry ban. The court acknowledged that California law strictly prohibits issuance of open-carry permits in areas where 95% of Californians live in counties with populations above 200,000. The decision references historical analysis from the Founding era and 1868, with the court noting that the overwhelming historical consensus showed open carry was protected at both periods. The opinion explicitly engages with the Supreme Court's Bruen precedent regarding historical analogues for firearm restrictions.</p>

The drug is an oral endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonist supported by Phase 3 DUPLEX study data showing significant proteinuria reduction compared to irbesartan in children and adults with FSGS. If approved, sparsentan would be the first treatment for this rare kidney disease, which is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. The supplemental NDA represents a proteinuria reduction as a validated regulatory endpoint in FSGS and would provide a non-immunosuppressive treatment option for both adult and pediatric patients at risk of progression.</p>

            <p class="summary">Immunome announced positive topline results in December 2025 from the global pivotal Phase 3 RINGSIDE trial of varegacestat, an investigational oral once-daily gamma secretase inhibitor, in patients with progressing desmoid tumors. The trial met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival with an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.16, p&lt;0.0001). The confirmed objective response rate was 56% with varegacestat versus 9% with placebo (p&lt;0.0001) based on RECIST v1.1 criteria. An exploratory analysis showed varegacestat demonstrated a median best change in tumor volume of -83%. Desmoid tumors affect approximately 1,000-1,650 people diagnosed each year in the United States with no current approved treatments, and Immunome is planning an FDA application for the second quarter of 2026.</p>
